In Switzerland, ever greater numbers of people are travelling longer distances and more frequently. Travel currently accounts for over a third of the total energy use in the country. Simply extending the transport infrastructure to cope with this is not a viable solution long term. New approaches and better information are needed in order to make mobility more efficient. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a concept in which means of transport such as cars, scooters, bikes etc. are not so much seen as private property but are instead used as a service as required â€“ and can then be made available to other users. Known as multi-modal mobility, this system encompassing all mobility service providers can only operate properly if real-time data is available and interlinked. 

[sharedmobility.ch](https://sharedmobility.ch) is the national shared mobility platform and shows location and availability of all participating shared mobility providers. The data shown on the map is also available as [Open Data](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/standorte-und-verfugbarkeit-von-shared-mobility-angeboten).

This documentation guides you to all sharedmobility.ch ressources.
