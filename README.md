In Switzerland, ever greater numbers of people are travelling longer distances and more frequently. Travel currently accounts for over a third of the total energy use in the country. Simply extending the transport infrastructure to cope with this is not a viable solution long term. New approaches and better information are needed in order to make mobility more efficient. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a con-cept in which means of transport such as the car are not so much seen as private property but are instead used as a service as required â€“ and can then be made available to other users. Known as multi-modal mobility, this system encompassing all mobility service providers can only operate properly if real-time data is available and interlinked. 

The aim is therefore to create a national platform that gives public access to the aggregated data of all interested Shared Mobility providers in real time and at a high quality. As the data is connected auto-matically to the internet via an IT interface, it can be kept up to date with a minimum of effort. The aggregated data can be integrated directly into third-party applications via predefined interfaces.
